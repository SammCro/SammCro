## 🚀 My AI Tech Stack Overview

These are the key technologies I explore or use in building AI-powered applications:

🐧 Operating Systems
Linux / Debian / Ubuntu – My go-to environments for development, server management, and container-based deployments. I rely heavily on CLI tools and shell scripting for automation.

🧬 Version Control & DevOps
Git / BitBucket / GitFlow – Used for managing version control, collaborative workflows, and branching strategies in team-based development.

Docker – Essential for containerizing applications, ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production environments.

🔄 Messaging & Caching
Apache Kafka – Utilized for building real-time, event-driven architectures and high-throughput data pipelines.

RabbitMQ – Employed as a reliable message broker between microservices, ensuring asynchronous communication.

Redis – Used for in-memory caching and lightweight pub/sub messaging to boost application performance.

💾 Databases
MySQL / PostgreSQL – Preferred for relational data models and applications that require transactional integrity and strong consistency.

MongoDB – Used for flexible schema design and fast iterations in NoSQL-based applications.

💻 Web Development
JavaScript / React.js / Node.js – I build responsive front-end interfaces with React and scalable server-side APIs with Node.js for full-stack applications.

☕️ Java Backend Development
Core Java / Spring Boot / Hibernate / Spring Security / Maven – These are my core tools for building robust, secure, and maintainable backend services. I use Maven for project build and dependency management.

🔄 CI/CD & Infrastructure
CI/CD – I integrate pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Bitbucket Pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment workflows.

Terraform – I use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision, scale, and manage cloud infrastructure reliably and reproducibly.

Kubernetes – My preferred platform for orchestrating microservices, managing container lifecycles, and scaling applications in production.
